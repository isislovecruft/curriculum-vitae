\WorkEntry{Core Tor Software Developer}{2010 -- 2018}{The Tor Project,
  Contractor}{Lead developer and maintainer of systems and components for Tor
  bridge distribution, which includes managing access to a database of
  all secret entrance relays in the Tor network, compartmentalising
  this data via hashring structures in order to restrict access by
  which distribution method is used, and securing the interfaces by
  which which Tor users may retrieve this data from adversaries
  hostile to Tor usage.  Past work on identifying and patching user
  fingerprinting and security issues
  for Tor Browser.  Ongoing efforts include improving Tor's circuit-level protocols
  and cryptography, designing and implementing an

\WorkEntry{Software Developer and Security Consultant}{2011 -- 2012}{LEAP
  Encryption Access Project, Part-time}{Development of several asynchronous
  servers, including a distributed and scalable transparently-encrypting
  remailer, which, at the time of design and implementation, handled seventeen
  million email users per day.  The system, without modification, now handles
  over a hundred million daily users.  Conducted security audits for systems
  components and dependencies, and filed several CVEs in widely used
  software, from Python's package manager to a GnuPG library in use by
  over thirty Bitcoin exchanges. Provided extensive consulting with respect
  to systems architecture and cryptographic engineering, including the
  design of an alternative OpenPGP keyserver.}

\WorkEntry{Software Design Consultant}{2011 -- 2012}{Electronic Frontier
  Foundation}{Worked with developers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
  (EFF) technical team to design a system for heuristic classification of
  benign network anomalies (e.g. due to NAT routers mangling packets) and
  malicious behaviours in TCP/UDP packet routing.  The system, called
  Switzerland, can be used between two parties to determine if a malicious
  adversary is altering their digital communications, as well as to inform
  users of the types of malicious behaviours present in packet flows.}

\WorkEntry{Software Developer and Distributed Systems Architect}{2010 -- 2012}
{The Tor Project/Open Observatory of Network Interference}{Reverse
  engineered the software and network testing methodologies of dozens of

  the Open Observatory of Network Inference (OONI): a global, distributed
  platform for detection and measurement of network anomalies, including
  online censorship and both passive and active malicious behaviours.
  Designed and developed distributed backend systems for collection of
  measurement data which are now deployed on over 300,000 MLab and PlanetLab
  servers worldwide.  Researched, designed, and published open specifications
  for effective methodologies for detection of anomalous behaviour.  Designed
  and developed numerous tests which run on the OONI platform, including tests
  for misbehaving and poisoned DNS servers, captive portal detection and
  misbehaviour, and anomalous behaviours within Transport Layer Protocol (TLS)
  handshake and session resumption negotiation.}

  end-to-end-encrypted, synchronous communications protocol with low overhead,
  such that it could feasibly be deployed over an SMS-based transport within
  Open Whispersystems flagship open source product TextSecure (now called
  Signal).  Later, researched the feasibility and efficiency of applying the
  Multi-Party Off-The-Record (MPOTR) protocol.  During this time, I also
  mentored several students in various secure mobile applications development
  projects, including aspects of protocol design, cryptography, and backend
  systems design, for Open Whispersystems.}
